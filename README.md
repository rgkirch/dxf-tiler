* **Skip Blank Pages:** When checked, the PDF will only contain pages that have actual drawing lines on them. Uncheck this if you want to print the entire empty grid for layout purposes.
* **Force Black Lines:** Ignores the colors defined in your DXF file and prints all lines in solid black. Useful if your CAD layer colors (like yellow or cyan) are hard to see on white paper.
* **Labels in Margin:** Moves the "Row 1, Col 1" text labels outside of the cut lines/printable area. This prevents the text from overlapping with your actual template.
